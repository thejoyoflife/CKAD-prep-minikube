- Ephemeral volumes are, by default, mounted in the container filesystems with full permissions for everyones and with owner/group as root. Persistent volumes are also mounted with owner/group as root, but the write permission on the directory is prohibited for group and other users.
- The permission of the mounted directory can be manually changed from an `init container` so that the general containers do not interfere (e.g. delete files created by other container from another container) with each other. `chmod og-w -R /tmp/share` can be used from a busybox init container to change the permission as required. For, persistent volumes, the permission is already set like this automatically by the system.
